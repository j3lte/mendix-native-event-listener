## Native Event Listener

![marketplace](/assets/MarketPlaceIcon.png)

Listen for native events on your page. This is similar to the Custom Event Listener (for web) on the Mendix MarketPlace

## Features

- The widget will listen for native events in your page
- When this event is detected, it can execute an action (Nanoflow, microflow, etc...)
- If you provide an attribute, it will put the value coming from `Event.detail` in this attribute before executing the action

## Example

![](/assets/Page.png)
![](/assets/Widget.png)
![](/assets/SingleAction.png)

- I have configured the widget to listen for a Native Event with name 'PressedButton'
- When this event is detected, it will execute the Nanoflow `OnAction`

Somewhere else in the page (in this case the button), I execute a Nanoflow that will execute a Javascript Action with the following code:
